4. algorithm planning:
	
	a few of the more basic things from the brute force can be held over like the fuel checks and how we develop the cost itself
	the main time saving angle in our math comes from avoiding needing to calculate every possible route to compare.
	I kind of like a greedy approach since no matter what we do, we cut some corners, but I think I'll settle on A* with some partitioning and other basic sorting out
	

5. pseudocode
//first step partition our network
